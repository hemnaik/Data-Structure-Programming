    - Linked List Rotation  
    - Stack using Linked List
    - Queue using Linked List 
    - Sorting techniques 
    - Circular Queue 
    - Matrix programming

# Requirements of Core DSA 
  - There are numberous requirements of Data Structures and algorithm development. Some of them are
     - Data Structure is used to manipulate and store data magnificently for the future use and in order to construct equipped systems.
     - Memory management, quite manipulation of hardware resources, architecture styles of systems are part of Data Structures.
     - Allocation of memory, allocation of resources and organisations of I/O data also falls under Data Structures.
     - The work flow of any newly developed system either it is embedded, organic or semi-detached the algorithms are most useful for understanding their flow and sequence.
     - Each and every practical implementation of code requires work flow or algorithm for successful compilation and for generating required throughput.
# Applications of Data Structure 
 - Memory manipulation and allocation
 - Problem Solving
 - Flow and product development
 - Hardware manipulation and sensor development
 - Core programming
# Other Topics of Data Structure
- There are many topics to be covered under Data Structure subject like Hash Programming, coillision avoidance and Tower of Hanoi etc.
- All the problems and their corresponding solutions in Data Struture are predefinly stated.
- There are three techniques for coillision avoidance like Linear Probing, Quadratic Probing and Chaining.
- Similarly, there are many topics like Cube sort, star sort, linear searching, recurrence relations etc.
