# Requirements of Core DSA
  - There are numberous requirements of Data Structures and algorithm development. Some of them are
     - Data Structure is used to manipulate and store data magnificently for the future use and in order to construct equipped systems.
     - Memory management, quite manipulation of hardware resources, architecture styles of systems are part of Data Structures.
     - Allocation of memory, allocation of resources and organisations of I/O data also falls under Data Structures.
     - The work flow of any newly developed system either it is embedded, organic or semi-detached the algorithms are most useful for understanding their flow and sequence.
     - Each and every practical implementation of code requires work flow or algorithm for successful compilation and for generating required throughput.
# Applications of Data Structure 
 - Memory manipulation and allocation
 - Problem Solving
 - Flow and product development
 - Hardware manipulation and sensor development
 - Core programming
